# Robot Code for Team 6013's 2016 Robot

Basic drive code, with a feature that allows data from the SmartDashboard tables to be saved to a flash drive on the robot.  There is a class named MemoryTable that implements the ITable interface, and this allows the code to log the data without taking network bandwidth (since the table is in Memory instead of the network).
